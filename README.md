Sweet, Simple Apps designed for a specialised purpose.

## Basic Requirements (Why we created this)
The apps in this repository meet these three requirements:
- They must be highly customizable and open to modification.
- They must feature easy to use interfaces, without being overcomplicated
- They must be independant (or as much as possible) and be standalone, requiring no install process.

## Upcoming Programs
